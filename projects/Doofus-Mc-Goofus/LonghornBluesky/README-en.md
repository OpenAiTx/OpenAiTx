    ![The same client, but now logged in. A post by MondySpartan is open saying "Based on these...I also made variants for Windows Longhorn/Vista!". Attached are boot-screen concepts for pre-reset Windows Longhorn.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Doofus-Mc-Goofus/LonghornBluesky/main/tease2.png)

    ![The home page of the client. There is a section with four tabs. The first tab, titled "Discover," is selected. Above it is a box for posting, with the default text "Whats Up?".](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Doofus-Mc-Goofus/LonghornBluesky/main/tease4.png)
