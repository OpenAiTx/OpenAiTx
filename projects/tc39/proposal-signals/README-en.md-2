They are only evaluated when their value is explicitly requested.\n* **Memoization** - Computed Signals cache their last value so that computations that don't have changes in their dependencies do not need to be re-evaluated, no matter how many times they are accessed.\n\n## Motivation for standardizing Signals\n\n#### Interoperability\n\nEach Signal implementation has its own auto-tracking mechanism, to keep track of the sources encountered when evaluating a computed Signal. This makes it hard to share models, components, and libraries between different frameworks--they tend to come with a false coupling to their view engine (given that Signals are usually implemented as part of JS frameworks).\n\nA goal of this proposal is to fully decouple the reactive model from the rendering view, enabling developers to migrate to new rendering technologies without rewriting their non-UI code, or develop shared reactive models in JS to be deployed in different contexts. Unfortunately, due to versioning and duplication, it has turned out to be impractical to reach a strong level of sharing via JS-level libraries--built-ins offer a stronger sharing guarantee.\n\n#### Performance/Memory usage\n\nIt is always a small potential performance boost to ship less code due to commonly used libraries being built-in, but implementations of Signals are generally pretty small, so we don't expect this effect to be very large.\n\nWe suspect that native C++ implementations of Signal-related data structures and algorithms can be slightly more efficient than what is achievable in JS, by a constant factor. However, no algorithmic changes are anticipated vs. what would be present in a polyfill; engines are not expected to be magic here, and the reactivity algorithms themselves will be well-defined and unambiguous.\n\nThe champion group expects to develop various implementations of Signals, and use these to investigate these performance possibilities.\n\n#### DevTools\n\nWith existing JS-language Signal libraries, it can be difficult to trace things like:\n* The callstack across a chain of computed Signals, showing the causal chain for an error\n* The reference graph among Signals, when one depends on another -- important when debugging memory usage\n\nBuilt-in Signals enable JS runtimes and DevTools to potentially have improved support for inspecting Signals, particularly for debugging or performance analysis, whether this is built into browsers or through a shared extension. Existing tools such as the element inspector, performance snapshot, and memory profilers could be updated to specifically highlight Signals in their presentation of information.\n\n#### Secondary benefits\n\n##### Benefits of a standard library\n\nIn general, JavaScript has had a fairly minimal standard library, but a trend in TC39 has been to make JS more of a \"batteries-included\" language, with a high-quality, built-in set of functionality available. For example, Temporal is replacing moment.js, and a number of small features, e.g., `Array.prototype.flat` and `Object.groupBy` are replacing many lodash use cases. Benefits include smaller bundle sizes, improved stability and quality, less to learn when joining a new project, and a generally common vocabulary across JS developers.\n\n##### HTML/DOM Integration (a future possibility)\n\nCurrent work in W3C and by browser implementors is seeking to bring native templating to HTML ([DOM Parts][wicg-pr-1023] and [Template Instantiation][wicg-propsal-template-instantiation]). Additionally, the W3C Web Components CG is exploring the possibility of extending Web Components to offer a fully declarative HTML API. To accomplish both of these goals, eventually a reactive primitive will be needed by HTML. Additionally, many ergonomic improvements to the DOM through integration of Signals can be imagined and have been asked for by the community.\n\n[wicg-pr-1023]: https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/pull/1023\n[wicg-propsal-template-instantiation]: https://github.com/WICG/webcomponents/blob/gh-pages/proposals/Template-Instantiation.md\n\n> Note, this integration would be a separate effort to come later, not part of this proposal itself.\n\n##### Ecosystem information exchange (*not* a reason to ship)\n\nStandardization efforts can sometimes be helpful just at the \"community\" level, even without changes in browsers. The Signals effort is bringing together many different framework authors for a deep discussion about the nature of reactivity, algorithms and interoperability. This has already been useful, and does not justify inclusion in JS engines and browsers; Signals should only be added to the JavaScript standard if there are significant benefits *beyond* the ecosystem information exchange enabled.\n\n## Design goals for Signals\n\nIt turns out that existing Signal libraries are not all that different from each other, at their core. This proposal aims to build on their success by implementing the important qualities of many of those libraries.\n\n### Core features\n\n* A Signal type which represents state, i.e. writable Signal. This is a value that others can read.\n* A computed/memo/derived Signal type, which depends on others and is lazily calculated and cached.\n    * Computation is lazy, meaning computed Signals aren't calculated again by default when one of their dependencies changes, but rather only run if someone actually reads them.\n    * Computation is \"[glitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming#Glitches)-free\", meaning no unnecessary calculations are ever performed. This implies that, when an application reads a computed Signal, there is a topological sorting of the potentially dirty parts of the graph to run, to eliminate any duplicates.\n    * Computation is cached, meaning that if, after the last time a dependency changes, no dependencies have changed, then the computed Signal is *not* recalculated when accessed.\n    * Custom comparisons are possible for computed Signals as well as state Signals, to note when further computed Signals which depend on them should be updated.\n* Reactions to the condition where a computed Signal has one of its dependencies (or nested dependencies) become \"dirty\" and change, meaning that the Signal's value might be outdated.\n    * This reaction is meant to schedule more significant work to be performed later.\n    * Effects are implemented in terms of these reactions, plus framework-level scheduling.\n    * Computed signals need the ability to react to whether they are registered as a (nested) dependency of one of these reactions.\n* Enable JS frameworks to do their own scheduling. No Promise-style built-in forced-on scheduling.\n    * Synchronous reactions are needed to enable scheduling later work based on framework logic.\n    * Writes are synchronous and immediately take effect (a framework which batches writes can do that on top).\n    * It is possible to separate checking whether an effect may be \"dirty\" from actually running the effect (enabling a two-stage effect scheduler).\n* Ability to read Signals *without* triggering dependencies to be recorded (`untrack`)\n* Enable composition of different codebases which use Signals/reactivity, e.g.,\n    * Using multiple frameworks together as far as tracking/reactivity itself goes (modulo omissions, see below)\n    * Framework-independent reactive data structures (e.g., recursively reactive store proxy, reactive Map and Set and Array, etc.)\n\n### Soundness\n\n* Discourage/prohibit naive misuse of synchronous reactions.\n    * Soundness risk: it may expose \"[glitches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming#Glitches)\" if improperly used: If rendering is done immediately when a Signal is set, it may expose incomplete application state to the end user. Therefore, this feature should only be used to intelligently schedule work for later, once application logic is finished.\n    * Solution: Disallow reading and writing any Signal from within a synchronous reaction callback\n* Discourage `untrack` and mark its unsound nature\n    * Soundness risk: allows the creation of computed Signals whose value depends on other Signals, but which aren't updated when those Signals change. It should be used when the untracked accesses will not change the result of the computation.\n    * Solution: The API is marked \"unsafe\" in the name.\n* Note: This proposal does allow signals to be both read and written from computed and effect signals, without restricting writes that come after reads, despite the soundness risk. This decision was taken to preserve flexibility and compatibility in integration with frameworks.\n\n### Surface API\n\n* Must be a solid base for multiple frameworks to implement their Signals/reactivity mechanisms.\n    * Should be a good base for recursive store proxies, decorator-based class field reactivity, and both `.value` and `[state, setState]`-style APIs.\n    * The semantics are able to express the valid patterns enabled by different frameworks. For example, it should be possible for these Signals to be the basis of either immediately-reflected writes or writes which are batched and applied later.\n* It would be nice if this API is usable directly by JavaScript developers.\n    * If a feature matches with an ecosystem concept, using common vocabulary is good.\n        * However, it is important to not literally shadow the exact same names!\n    * Tension between \"usability by JS devs\" and \"providing all the hooks to frameworks\"\n        * Idea: Provide all the hooks, but include errors when misused if possible.\n        * Idea: Put subtle APIs in a `subtle` namespace, similar to [`crypto.subtle`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Crypto/subtle), to mark the line between APIs which are necessary for more advanced usage like implementing a framework or building dev tools versus more everyday application development usage like instantiating signals for use with a framework.\n* Be implementable and usable with good performance -- the surface API doesn't cause too much overhead\n    * Enable subclassing, so that frameworks can add their own methods and fields, including private fields. This is important to avoid the need for additional allocations at the framework level. See \"Memory management\" below.\n\n### Memory management\n\n* If possible: A computed Signal should be garbage-collectable if nothing live is referencing it for possible future reads, even if it's linked into a broader graph which stays alive (e.g., by reading a state which remains live).",
