Whether or it not is stale will be known only when all immediate sources have been evaluated.\n- `~computing~`: This Signal's callback is currently being executed as a side-effect of a `.get()` call.\n- `~dirty~`: Either this Signal has a value which is known to be stale, or it has never been evaluated.\n\nThe transition graph is as follows:\n\n```mermaid\nstateDiagram-v2\n    [*] --> dirty\n    dirty --> computing: [4]\n    computing --> clean: [5]\n    clean --> dirty: [2]\n    clean --> checked: [3]\n    checked --> clean: [6]\n    checked --> dirty: [1]\n```\n\nThe transitions are:\n| Number | From | To | Condition | Algorithm |\n| ------ | ---- | -- | --------- | --------- |\n| 1 | `~checked~` | `~dirty~` | An immediate source of this signal, which is a computed signal, has been evaluated, and its value has changed. | Algorithm: recalculate dirty computed Signal |\n| 2 | `~clean~` | `~dirty~` | An immediate source of this signal, which is a State, has been set, with a value which is not equal to its previous value. | Method: `Signal.State.prototype.set(newValue)` |\n| 3 | `~clean~` | `~checked~` | A recursive, but not immediate, source of this signal, which is a State, has been set, with a value which is not equal to its previous value. | Method: `Signal.State.prototype.set(newValue)` |\n| 4 | `~dirty~` | `~computing~` | We are about to execute the `callback`. | Algorithm: recalculate dirty computed Signal |\n| 5 | `~computing~` | `~clean~` | The `callback` has finished evaluating and either returned a value or thrown an exception. | Algorithm: recalculate dirty computed Signal |\n| 6 | `~checked~` | `~clean~` | All immediate sources of this signal have been evaluated, and all have been discovered unchanged, so we are now known not to be stale. | Algorithm: recalculate dirty computed Signal |\n\n#### `Signal.Computed` Internal slots\n\n- `value`: The previous cached value of the Signal, or `~uninitialized~` for a never-read computed Signal.

If this Signal's state is `~dirty~` or `~checked~`: Repeat the following steps until this Signal is `~clean~`:\n    1. Recurse up via `sources` to find the deepest, left-most (i.e. earliest observed) recursive source which is a Computed Signal marked `~dirty~` (cutting off search when hitting a `~clean~` Computed Signal, and including this Computed Signal as the last thing to search).\n    1. Perform the \"recalculate dirty computed Signal\" algorithm on that Signal.\n1. At this point, this Signal's state will be `~clean~`, and no recursive sources will be `~dirty~` or `~checked~`.
