Signals may be either \"state\" (just a value which is set manually) or \"computed\" (a formula based on other Signals).\n\nComputed Signals work by automatically tracking which other Signals are read during their evaluation. When a computed is read, it checks whether any of its previously recorded dependencies have changed, and re-evaluates itself if so. When multiple computed Signals are nested, all of the attribution of the tracking goes to the innermost one.\n\nComputed Signals are lazy, i.e., pull-based: they are only re-evaluated when they are accessed, even if one of their dependencies changed earlier.\n\nThe callback passed into computed Signals should generally be \"pure\" in the sense of being a deterministic, side-effect-free function of the other Signals which it accesses. At the same time, the timing of the callback being called is deterministic, allowing side effects to be used with care.\n\nSignals feature prominent caching/memoization: both state and computed Signals remember their current value, and only trigger recalculation of computed Signals which reference them if they actually change. A repeated comparison of old vs new values isn't even needed--the comparison is made once when the source Signal is reset/re-evaluated, and the Signal mechanism keeps track of which things referencing that Signal have not updated based on the new value yet. Internally, this is generally represented through \"graph coloring\" as described in (Milo's blog post).\n\nComputed Signals track their dependencies dynamically--each time they are run, they may end up depending on different things, and that precise dependency set is kept fresh in the Signal graph. This means that if you have a dependency needed on only one branch, and the previous calculation took the other branch, then a change to that temporarily unused value will not cause the computed Signal to be recalculated, even when pulled.\n\nUnlike JavaScript Promises, everything in Signals runs synchronously:\n- Setting a Signal to a new value is synchronous, and this is immediately reflected when reading any computed Signal which depends on it afterwards. There is no built-in batching of this mutation.\n- Reading computed Signals is synchronous--their value is always available.\n- The `notify` callback in Watchers, as explained below, runs synchronously, during the `.set()` call which triggered it (but after graph coloring has completed).\n\nLike Promises, Signals can represent an error state: If a computed Signal's callback throws, then that error is cached just like another value, and rethrown every time the Signal is read.\n\n### Understanding the Signal class\n\nA `Signal` instance represents the capability to read a dynamically changing value whose updates are tracked over time. It also implicitly includes the capability to subscribe to the Signal, implicitly through a tracked access from another computed Signal.\n\nThe API here is designed to match the very rough ecosystem consensus among a large fraction of Signal libraries in the use of names like \"signal\", \"computed\" and \"state\". However, access to Computed and State Signals is through a `.get()` method, which disagrees with all popular Signal APIs, which either use a `.value`-style accessor, or `signal()` call syntax.\n\nThe API is designed to reduce the number of allocations, to make Signals suitable for embedding in JavaScript frameworks while reaching same or better performance than existing framework-customized Signals. This implies:\n- State Signals are a single writable object, which can be both accessed and set from the same reference. (See implications below in the \"Capability separation\" section.)\n- Both State and Computed Signals are designed to be subclassable, to facilitate frameworks' ability to add additional properties through public and private class fields (as well as methods for using that state).\n- Various callbacks (e.g., `equals`, the computed callback) are called with the relevant Signal as the `this` value for context, so that a new closure isn't needed per Signal. Instead, context can be saved in extra properties of the signal itself.\n\nSome error conditions enforced by this API:\n- It is an error to read a computed recursively.\n- The `notify` callback of a Watcher cannot read or write any signals\n- If a computed Signal's callback throws, then subsequent accesses of the Signal rethrow that cached error, until one of the dependencies changes and it is recalculated.\n\nSome conditions which are *not* enforced:\n- Computed Signals can write to other Signals, synchronously within their callback\n- Work which is queued by a Watcher's `notify` callback may read or write signals, making it possible to replicate [classic React antipatterns](https://react.dev/learn/you-might-not-need-an-effect) in terms of Signals!\n\n### Implementing effects\n\nThe `Watcher` interface defined above gives the basis for implementing typical JS APIs for effects: callbacks which are re-run when other Signals change, purely for their side effect. The `effect` function used above in the initial example can be defined as follows:\n\n```ts\n// This function would usually live in a library/framework, not application code\n// NOTE: This scheduling logic is too basic to be useful. Do not copy/paste.\nlet pending = false;\n\nlet w = new Signal.subtle.Watcher(() => {\n    if (!pending) {\n        pending = true;\n        queueMicrotask(() => {\n            pending = false;\n            for (let s of w.getPending()) s.get();\n            w.watch();\n        });\n    }\n});\n\n// An effect effect Signal which evaluates to cb, which schedules a read of\n// itself on the microtask queue whenever one of its dependencies might change\nexport function effect(cb) {\n    let destructor;\n    let c = new Signal.Computed(() => { destructor?.(); destructor = cb(); });\n    w.watch(c);\n    c.get();\n    return () => { destructor?.(); w.unwatch(c) };\n}\n```\n\nThe Signal API does not include any built-in function like `effect`. This is because effect scheduling is subtle and often ties into framework rendering cycles and other high-level framework-specific state or strategies which JS does not have access to.\n\nWalking through the different operations used here: The `notify` callback passed into `Watcher` constructor is the function that is called when the Signal goes from a \"clean\" state (where we know the cache is initialized and valid) into a \"checked\" or \"dirty\" state (where the cache might or might not be valid because at least one of the states which this recursively depends on has been changed).\n\nCalls to `notify` are ultimately triggered by a call to `.set()` on some state Signal. This call is synchronous: it happens before `.set` returns. But there's no need to worry about this callback observing the Signal graph in a half-processed state, because during a `notify` callback, no Signal can be read or written, even in an `untrack` call. Because `notify` is called during `.set()`, it is interrupting another thread of logic, which might not be complete. To read or write Signals from `notify`, schedule work to run later, e.g., by writing the Signal down in a list to later be accessed, or with `queueMicrotask` as above.\n\nNote that it is perfectly possible to use Signals effectively without `Signal.subtle.Watcher` by scheduling polling of computed Signals, as Glimmer does. However, many frameworks have found that it is very often useful to have this scheduling logic run synchronously, so the Signals API includes it.\n\nBoth computed and state Signals are garbage-collected like any JS values. But Watchers have a special way of holding things alive: Any Signals which are watched by a Watcher will be held alive as long as any of the underlying states are reachable, as these may trigger a future `notify` call (and then a future `.get()`). For this reason, remember to call `Watcher.prototype.unwatch` to clean up effects.\n\n### An unsound escape hatch\n\n`Signal.subtle.untrack` is an escape hatch allowing reading Signals *without* tracking those reads. This capability is unsafe because it allows the creation of computed Signals whose value depends on other Signals, but which aren't updated when those Signals change. It should be used when the untracked accesses will not change the result of the computation.\n\n<!--\nTODO: Show example where it's a good idea to use untrack\n\n### Using watched/unwatched",
