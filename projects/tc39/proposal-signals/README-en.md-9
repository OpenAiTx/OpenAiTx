As described above, observables or other publish/subscribe mechanisms are not a complete solution to many types of UI programming, due to too much error-prone configuration work for developers, and wasted work due to lack of laziness, among other issues.\n\n**Q**: Why are Signals being proposed in TC39 rather than DOM, given that most applications of it are web-based?\n\n**A**: Some coauthors of this proposal are interested in non-web UI environments as a goal, but these days, either venue may be suitable for that, as web APIs are being more frequently implemented outside the web. Ultimately, Signals don't need to depend on any DOM APIs, so either way works. If someone has a strong reason for this group to switch, please let us know in an issue. For now, all contributors have signed the TC39 intellectual property agreements, and the plan is to present this to TC39.\n\n**Q**: How long is it going to take until I can use standard Signals?\n\n**A**: A polyfill is already available, but it's best to not rely on its stability, as this API evolves during its review process. In some months or a year, a high-quality, high-performance stable polyfill should be usable, but this will still be subject to committee revisions and not yet standard. Following the typical trajectory of a TC39 proposal, it is expected to take at least 2-3 years at an absolute minimum for Signals to be natively available across all browsers going back a few versions, such that polyfills are not needed.\n\n**Q**: How will we prevent standardizing the wrong kind of Signals too soon, just like {{JS/web feature that you don't like}}?\n\n**A**: The authors of this proposal plan to go the extra mile with prototyping and proving things out prior to requesting stage advancement at TC39. See \"Status and development plan\" above. If you see gaps in this plan or opportunities for improvement, please file an issue explaining.\n",
