Test that it works efficiently and correctly in these contexts.\n- Have a solid understanding on the space of possible extensions to the API, and have concluded which (if any) should be added into this proposal.\n\n## Signal algorithms\n\nThis section describes each of the APIs exposed to JavaScript, in terms of the algorithms that they implement. This can be thought of as a proto-specification, and is included at this early point to nail down one possible set of semantics, while being very open to changes.\n\nSome aspects of the algorithm:\n- The order of reads of Signals within a computed is significant, and is observable in the order that certain callbacks (which `Watcher` is invoked, `equals`, the first parameter to `new Signal.Computed`, and the `watched`/`unwatched` callbacks) are executed. This means that the sources of a computed Signal must be stored ordered.\n- These four callbacks might all throw exceptions, and these exceptions are propagated in a predictable manner to the calling JS code. The exceptions do *not* halt execution of this algorithm or leave the graph in a half-processed state. For errors thrown in the `notify` callback of a Watcher, that exception is sent to the `.set()` call which triggered it, using an AggregateError if multiple exceptions were thrown. The others (including `watched`/`unwatched`?) are stored in the value of the Signal, to be rethrown when read, and such a rethrowing Signal can be marked `~clean~` just like any other with a normal value.\n- Care is taken to avoid circularities in cases of computed signals which are not \"watched\" (being observed by any Watcher), so that they can be garbage collected independently from other parts of the signal graph. Internally, this can be implemented with a system of generation numbers which are always collected; note that optimized implementations may also include local per-node generation numbers, or avoid tracking some numbers on watched signals.\n\n### Hidden global state\n\nSignal algorithms need to reference certain global state. This state is global for the entire thread, or \"agent\".\n\n- `computing`: The innermost computed or effect Signal currently being reevaluated due to a `.get` or `.run` call, or `null`. Initially `null`.\n- `frozen`: Boolean denoting whether there is a callback currently executing which requires that the graph not be modified. Initially `false`.\n- `generation`: An incrementing integer, starting at 0, used to track how current a value is while avoiding circularities.\n\n### The `Signal` namespace\n\n`Signal` is an ordinary object which serves as a namespace for Signal-related classes and functions.\n\n`Signal.subtle` is a similar inner namespace object.\n\n### The `Signal.State` class\n\n#### `Signal.State` internal slots\n\n- `value`: The current value of the state signal\n- `equals`: The comparison function used when changing values\n- `watched`: The callback to be called when the signal becomes observed by an effect\n- `unwatched`: The callback to be called when the signal is no longer observed by an effect\n- `sinks`: Set of watched signals which depend on this one\n\n#### Constructor: `Signal.State(initialValue, options)`\n\n1.

Set the `state` of all `sinks` of this Signal to (if it is a Computed Signal) `~dirty~` if they were previously clean, or (if it is a Watcher) `~pending~` if it was previously `~watching~`.\n1. Set the `state` of all of the sinks' Computed Signal dependencies (recursively) to `~checked~` if they were previously `~clean~` (that is, leave dirty markings in place), or for Watchers, `~pending~` if previously `~watching~`.\n1.
