The table below lists out specific definitions for internal axios error.  |\n| status   | HTTP response status code. See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) for common HTTP response status code meanings. \n\nBelow is a list of potential axios identified error:\n\n| Code                      | Definition                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |\n| --- | --- |\n| ERR_BAD_OPTION_VALUE      | Invalid value provided in axios configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ERR_BAD_OPTION            | Invalid option provided in axios configuration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |\n| ERR_NOT_SUPPORT           | Feature or method not supported in the current axios environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| ERR_DEPRECATED            | Deprecated feature or method used in axios.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| ERR_INVALID_URL           | Invalid URL provided for axios request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ECONNABORTED              | Typically indicates that the request has been timed out (unless `transitional.clarifyTimeoutError` is set) or aborted by the browser or its plugin.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |\n| ERR_CANCELED              | Feature or method is canceled explicitly by the user using an AbortSignal (or a CancelToken).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |\n| ETIMEDOUT                 | Request timed out due to exceeding default axios timelimit. `transitional.clarifyTimeoutError` must be set to `true`, otherwise a generic `ECONNABORTED` error will be thrown instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ERR_NETWORK               | Network-related issue.
