While it can handle larger or smaller scales, visual quality may degrade quickly. It is not recommended for images where precise pixel integrity is critical, such as portraits, graphs, or detailed technical drawings, as seam carving introduces distortions. It is highly recommended to test your images at various sizes to ensure they meet your visual expectations.\n\n#### CORS\n\nDue to browser security restrictions, images loaded from a different origin (domain, protocol, or port) than the web page will trigger a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) error. This component requires access to the raw pixel data of the image, which is restricted by CORS.\n\nTo use images from a different origin, the server hosting the images must be configured to send appropriate CORS headers (e.g., `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` or `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: your-domain.com`). Without these headers, the component will not be able to process the image.\n\n(FYI, for testing purposes, any image on imgur has the necessary CORS headers)\n\n#### Fallback\n\nIf the component fails to load or process the image, or throws an internal error, it will gracefully degrade to injecting a standard `<img>` tag into the `<fluid-img>` component, with 100% width & height, ensuring the image is still displayed.\n\n## Options\n\nUsage: `<fluid-img src=\"image.jpg\" generator=\"random\" max-carve-up-scale=\"5\"></fluid-img>`\n\nBy default, the `random` generator is used as it is the fastest.\n\n| Option                         | Values                           | Default      | Description                                                                                                            |\n| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| `src`                          | URL                              |              | The URL of the image to be processed.                                                                                  |\n| `generator`                    | `random`, `predictive`           | `predictive` | The seam carving generator to use. `random` is faster but lower quality.                                               |\n| `scaling-axis`                 | `horizontal`, `vertical`, `auto` | `horizontal` | The axis for scaling. `auto` scales horizontally or vertically based on aspect ratio changes.                          |\n| `mask`                         | URL                              |              | The URL of a mask image.
