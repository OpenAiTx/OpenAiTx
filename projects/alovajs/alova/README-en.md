## What is alova?

alova (pronounced /əˈləʊva/) is a next-generation request library that radically simplifies your API integration workflow, reducing what used to take 7 complex steps down to just 1 - simply select your API and go.

## Features

- Incredibly simple to use with a minimal learning curve.
- More modern OpenAPI solution - say goodbye to tedious intermediate API documentation.
- Compatible with client-side technologies and request libraries: `react/vue/svelte/solid/next/nuxt/sveltkit/solid-start/uniapp/taro/...` + `fetch/XMLHttpRequest/axios/...`
- Compatible with server-side technologies and request libraries: `nodejs/deno/bun/...` + `fetch/XMLHttpRequest/axios/...`
- 15+ high-performance request strategies to handle complex request scenarios, helping you develop more efficient applications faster.

## Is there any difference?

Unlike libraries such as `@tanstack/react-request`, `swrjs`, and `useRequest` from `ahooks`, alova aims to make requests very simple and maintain more efficient data interaction. We consider both developers and App users. For developers, alova provides them with the ultimate user experience, and for application users, they can enjoy the smooth experience brought by alova's high-performance data interaction.
