## ü™ü Windows Usage

1. Download the following files:

   * [`yt-dlp.exe`](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp)  
   * [`ffmpeg` Windows version](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-git-full.7z)

2. After extraction, place the following files in the same directory (e.g. `yt-dlp` folder):

   * `yt-dlp.exe`  
   * `ffmpeg.exe`  
   * `ffprobe.exe`  
   * `yt-dlp.bat` (script file)
3. Double-click to run `yt-dlp.bat` and follow the prompts to download the video.  
4. Edit config/config.ini to modify the default configuration.

## üì± Recommended Android Usage

1. Use the [Seal](https://github.com/JunkFood02/Seal) App to experience `yt-dlp` functionality on Android.
2. Installing Debian on termux can also download, but there's no need to use that; Seal is very user-friendly.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

1. **Batch Download Mode**: The script will automatically read `config\urls.txt` in the current directory, with one video link per line. If the file does not exist, it will be created automatically.
2. **Resource Usage Reminder**: Devices with limited memory should avoid downloading multiple large videos simultaneously or setting too high concurrency threads.
3. **CentOS Special Note**: Due to a special environment, it has not been fully tested yet; it is recommended to use in non-production environments. Other mainstream systems have been verified to work.
4. Linux version minor bug: The script checks dependencies once when running to the homepage; following the principle of code that runs is fine, so no fix has been made.
5. Windows version minor bug: When returning to the homepage from other pages and then making a selection, the default option may become invalid, causing a loop; limited capability, no proper fix yet.
Two solutions:
    1. Exit and restart
    2. Avoid default, just select by number
