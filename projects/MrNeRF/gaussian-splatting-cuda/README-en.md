A high-performance C++ and CUDA implementation of 3D Gaussian Splatting, built upon the [gsplat](https://github.com/nerfstudio-project/gsplat) rasterization backend.

## News
- **[2025-06-10]**: Fixed some issues. We are closing the gap to the gsplat metrics. However, there is still a small mismatch.
- **[2025-06-04]**: Added MCMC strategy with `--max-cap` command line option for controlling maximum Gaussian count.
- **[2025-06-03]**: Switched to Gsplat backend and updated license.
- **[2024-05-27]**: Updated to LibTorch 2.7.0 for better compatibility and performance. Breaking changes in optimizer state management have been addressed.
- **[2024-05-26]**: The current goal of this repo is to move towards a permissive license. Major work has been done to replace the rasterizer with the gsplat implementation.

## Metrics
Currently the implementation does not achieve on par results with gsplat-mcmc, but it is a work in progress.
It is just a matter of time to fix the bug. Help is welcome :) The metrics for the mcmc strategy are as follows:

## Build and Execution Instructions

### Software Prerequisites
1. **Linux** (tested with Ubuntu 22.04) - Windows is currently not supported
2. **CMake** 3.24 or higher
3. **CUDA** 11.8 or higher (may work with lower versions with manual configuration)
4. **Python** with development headers
5. **LibTorch 2.7.0** - Setup instructions below
6. Other dependencies are handled automatically by CMake

### Hardware Prerequisites
1. **NVIDIA GPU** with CUDA support
    - Successfully tested: RTX 4090, RTX A5000, RTX 3090Ti, A100
    - Known issue with RTX 3080Ti on larger datasets (see #21)
2. Minimum compute capability: 8.0

> If you successfully run on other hardware, please share your experience in the Discussions section!

### Build Instructions

```bash
# Clone the repository with submodules
git clone --recursive https://github.com/MrNeRF/gaussian-splatting-cuda
cd gaussian-splatting-cuda

# Download and setup LibTorch
wget https://download.pytorch.org/libtorch/cu118/libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0%2Bcu118.zip  
unzip libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0+cu118.zip -d external/
rm libtorch-cxx11-abi-shared-with-deps-2.7.0+cu118.zip
