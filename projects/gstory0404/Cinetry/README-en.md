# Cinetry

Cinetry is a cross-platform client software designed for media enthusiasts. The software does not provide any data but integrates the functionality of media servers added by users (such as Jellyfin, Emby, CMS, webdav, and IPTV). Through powerful data import, aggregated search, and one-click switching features, Cinetry enables users to easily manage content across multiple media servers and enjoy a consistent user experience, whether on Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, or iOS platforms.

## TODO
- TV version adaptation in progress  
- Web (docker version) adaptation basically completed
