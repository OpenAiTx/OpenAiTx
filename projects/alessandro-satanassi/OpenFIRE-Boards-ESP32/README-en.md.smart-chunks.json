    "Content": "Supported boards should have a name that corresponds to the `OPENFIRE_BOARD` definition as defined at the top of the file, followed by a map of what function each GPIO should have as a default (this is loaded when `OF_Prefs::toggles[OF_Const::customPins]` is set as *true* in the board's current prefs). Each GPIO the microcontroller has should be represented here, with unmapped pins given `btnUnmapped` and pins that are either reserved or not exposed to the user to be given `unavailable`. RP2040 and RP235X-A boards should have thirty pins maximum - note that even if the `rpipico` only exposes around 26 pins, it still takes the hidden GPIO into consideration.\n\n### `boardBoxPositions`\nLike `boardPresetsMap`, for each supported `OPENFIRE_BOARD`, this presents a map of roughly *where* each pin should be located in a Desktop App's graphical board view represented as a sum of two values - the left being the relative position as an positive integer starting from 1, and the right being an enum value of which side of the board the pin elements should be positioned by. Adding `posLeft`, `posRight`, and `posMiddle` will place this GPIO in the respective side of the board view, and adding `posNothing` (literally 0) will inform the app not to show this pin at all, which should be used for `unavailable` pins in `boardPresetsMap`. The amount of values should match the amount of GPIO as defined in the presets map.\n\n### `boardsAltPresets`\nThis is for optional alternative board presets, which are to be presented in a Board Layout view as a drop-down list of alt layout names. Each supported `OPENFIRE_BOARD` can be listed multiple times, one for each alt layout - the string after the board name indicating what label it should show in the interface, followed by a curly braced map of GPIO board functions indentically to `boardPresetsMap`; the same conventions and stipulations apply. This is primarily intended for matching the layout of adapter boards that use different suggested button mappings/wiring, such as `adafruitItsy`'s SAMCO 1.1 layout for those boards which has a different mapping from the default SAMCO 2.0 layout; also note that the current reference Desktop App supports exporting and importing custom layouts.\n\n## `boardPics/` - Board Vectors and Pin Highlights\nThis is the repository of board vectors that Desktop Apps should use for Board Layout views to graphically represent the current board that's docked to the application. Board vectors should be exported as *Plain SVG* (or equivalent), and added to the `vectors.qrc` resource file, where the alias for each file should match the names as defined in `OpenFIREshared.h`'s `OPENFIRE_BOARD` string for the board.\n\nThe current reference Desktop App is capable of showing *highlighted pins* when the user hovers over a GPIO pin item in the interface. To do this, the SVGs will need to be modified with the following (using Inkscape as the primary interface example):\n 1. If it's not already, group all of the image's existing board objects into its own group (name doesn't matter). Also make sure that the pin holes are actually transparent beneath and are not filled with a background color.\n 2. Create a new group that's *below* the board group - again, name doesn't matter, but for ease of use you should call it something like `OF`\n 3. Inside this newly made highlights group, create the highlight elements with no stroke, and basic single flat color fill (existing boards uses RGBA `ebe713`, or *R253/G231/B19*).\n 4.

    "Translation": "Supported boards should have a name that corresponds to the `OPENFIRE_BOARD` definition as defined at the top of the file, followed by a map of what function each GPIO should have as a default (this is loaded when `OF_Prefs::toggles[OF_Const::customPins]` is set as *true* in the board's current prefs). Each GPIO the microcontroller has should be represented here, with unmapped pins given `btnUnmapped` and pins that are either reserved or not exposed to the user to be given `unavailable`. RP2040 and RP235X-A boards should have thirty pins maximum - note that even if the `rpipico` only exposes around 26 pins, it still takes the hidden GPIO into consideration.\n\n### `boardBoxPositions`\nLike `boardPresetsMap`, for each supported `OPENFIRE_BOARD`, this presents a map of roughly *where* each pin should be located in a Desktop App's graphical board view represented as a sum of two values - the left being the relative position as an positive integer starting from 1, and the right being an enum value of which side of the board the pin elements should be positioned by. Adding `posLeft`, `posRight`, and `posMiddle` will place this GPIO in the respective side of the board view, and adding `posNothing` (literally 0) will inform the app not to show this pin at all, which should be used for `unavailable` pins in `boardPresetsMap`. The amount of values should match the amount of GPIO as defined in the presets map.\n\n### `boardsAltPresets`\nThis is for optional alternative board presets, which are to be presented in a Board Layout view as a drop-down list of alt layout names. Each supported `OPENFIRE_BOARD` can be listed multiple times, one for each alt layout - the string after the board name indicating what label it should show in the interface, followed by a curly braced map of GPIO board functions indentically to `boardPresetsMap`; the same conventions and stipulations apply. This is primarily intended for matching the layout of adapter boards that use different suggested button mappings/wiring, such as `adafruitItsy`'s SAMCO 1.1 layout for those boards which has a different mapping from the default SAMCO 2.0 layout; also note that the current reference Desktop App supports exporting and importing custom layouts.\n\n## `boardPics/` - Board Vectors and Pin Highlights\nThis is the repository of board vectors that Desktop Apps should use for Board Layout views to graphically represent the current board that's docked to the application. Board vectors should be exported as *Plain SVG* (or equivalent), and added to the `vectors.qrc` resource file, where the alias for each file should match the names as defined in `OpenFIREshared.h`'s `OPENFIRE_BOARD` string for the board.\n\nThe current reference Desktop App is capable of showing *highlighted pins* when the user hovers over a GPIO pin item in the interface. To do this, the SVGs will need to be modified with the following (using Inkscape as the primary interface example):\n 1. If it's not already, group all of the image's existing board objects into its own group (name doesn't matter). Also make sure that the pin holes are actually transparent beneath and are not filled with a background color.\n 2. Create a new group that's *below* the board group - again, name doesn't matter, but for ease of use you should call it something like `OF`\n 3. Inside this newly made highlights group, create the highlight elements with no stroke, and basic single flat color fill (existing boards uses RGBA `ebe713`, or *R253/G231/B19*).\n 4. Select the highlight element and go to the *Object Properties* tab (or equivalent that shows the *\"ID\"* line): each highlight element needs to have an ID named `OF_pinX` - where X == GPIO pin number, without a leading 0.\n 5.
