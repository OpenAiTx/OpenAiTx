4. Start writing with AI assistance!

### 3. Use the Seven-Step Methodology

NovelWeave implements the proven seven-step novel creation methodology:

```
1. /constitution  → Establish core creative principles
2. /specify       → Define story requirements
3. /clarify       → Resolve ambiguities through Q&A
4. /plan          → Design technical implementation
5. /tasks         → Break down into actionable steps
6. /write         → Execute the actual writing
7. /analyze       → Validate quality and consistency
```

## 📚 Seven-Step Methodology

### Step 1: `/constitution` - Creative Constitution

Define your uncompromisable writing principles, style guidelines, and core values that will guide your entire novel.

### Step 2: `/specify` - Story Specification

Like a product requirements document (PRD), define exactly what story you want to create, target audience, and success criteria.

### Step 3: `/clarify` - Critical Clarifications

AI identifies ambiguities in your specification and generates up to 5 key questions to eliminate confusion before writing.

### Step 4: `/plan` - Creative Plan

Transform abstract requirements into concrete technical solutions: chapter structure, character arcs, world-building, and plot timeline.

### Step 5: `/tasks` - Task Breakdown

Break down the plan into executable writing tasks with clear priorities and dependencies.

### Step 6: `/write` - Execute Writing

Write based on your tasks list, following your constitution principles and creative plan.

### Step 7: `/analyze` - Comprehensive Validation

Validate plot consistency, timeline accuracy, character development, and adherence to your creative principles.
