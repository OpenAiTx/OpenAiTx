I am not going to cover the full LLM training process, for that refer to nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy.\n\n### Step 1: Gather and Prepare Historical Texts \n\n- Collect .txt files of public domain books, documents, etc from your chosen time period (e.g., London 1800-1850) \n- Keep them within your chosen time/place window  \n- Clean the text files using a script or manually remove headers/footer from Project Gutenberg, Modern annotations or things like OCR errors.\n\n### Step 2: Build a Custom Tokenizer\n\n- Run train_tokenizer.py or train_tokenizer_hf.py on the cleaned data.\n- This will give you vocab.json and merges.txt\n- Thes files define vocab and merge rules for your model\n\n### Step 3: Train Your Model \n\n- Refer to [nanoGPT by Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT) for the training process or your chosen architecture’s docs.\n\n# FAQ\n\n## What is Selective Temporal Training ?\n\nSelective Temporal Training (STT) is a machine learning methodology where all training data is specifically curated to fall within a specific historical time period. It's done in order to model the language and knowledge of that era without influence from modern concepts. For example, the current model I have now (v0.5) is trained on data exclusively from 1800-1875, it's not fine tuned but trained from scratch resulting in output that reflects the linguistic style and historical context of that time period.\n\n## Why not just use fine-tuning or LoRA?\n\nFor this project I'm trying to create a language model that is unclouded from modern bias. If I fine-tune something like GPT-2, it's already pre-trained and that information won't go away. If I train from scratch the language model won't pretend to be old, it just will be. The Goal for this project right now is to create something can reason exclusively using knowledge from London books published between 1800 and 1875.\n\n## What kind of data did you use for training?\n",
