We believe that great software is built collaboratively, and every merged pull request breathes new life into the project.\n\nWe sincerely invite you to join our ranks of contributors and shape the future of Cherry Studio with us.\n\n## Contributor Rewards Program\n\nTo give back to our core contributors and create a virtuous cycle, we have established the following long-term incentive plan.\n\n**The inaugural tracking period for this program will be Q3 2025 (July, August, September). Rewards for this cycle will be distributed on October 1st.**\n\nWithin any tracking period (e.g., July 1st to September 30th for the first cycle), any developer who contributes more than **30 meaningful commits** to any of Cherry Studio's open-source projects on GitHub is eligible for the following benefits:\n\n- **Cursor Subscription Sponsorship**: Receive a **$70 USD** credit or reimbursement for your [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/) subscription, making AI your most efficient coding partner.\n- **Unlimited Model Access**: Get **unlimited** API calls for the **DeepSeek** and **Qwen** models.\n- **Cutting-Edge Tech Access**: Enjoy occasional perks, including API access to models like **Claude**, **Gemini**, and **OpenAI**, keeping you at the forefront of technology.\n\n## Growing Together & Future Plans\n\nA vibrant community is the driving force behind any sustainable open-source project. As Cherry Studio grows, so will our rewards program. We are committed to continuously aligning our benefits with the best-in-class tools and resources in the industry. This ensures our core contributors receive meaningful support, creating a positive cycle where developers, the community, and the project grow together.\n\n**Moving forward, the project will also embrace an increasingly open stance to give back to the entire open-source community.**\n\n## How to Get Started?\n\nWe look forward to your first Pull Request!\n\nYou can start by exploring our repositories, picking up a `good first issue`, or proposing your own enhancements. Every commit is a testament to the spirit of open source.\n\nThank you for your interest and contributions.\n\nLet's build together.\n\n# üè¢ Enterprise Edition\n\nBuilding on the Community Edition, we are proud to introduce **Cherry Studio Enterprise Edition**‚Äîa privately deployable AI productivity and management platform designed for modern teams and enterprises.\n\nThe Enterprise Edition addresses core challenges in team collaboration by centralizing the management of AI resources, knowledge, and data. It empowers organizations to enhance efficiency, foster innovation, and ensure compliance, all while maintaining 100% control over their data in a secure environment.\n\n## Core Advantages\n\n- **Unified Model Management**: Centrally integrate and manage various cloud-based LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini) and locally deployed private models. Employees can use them out-of-the-box without individual configuration.\n- **Enterprise-Grade Knowledge Base**: Build, manage, and share team-wide knowledge bases. Ensure knowledge is retained and consistent, enabling team members to interact with AI based on unified and accurate information.\n- **Fine-Grained Access Control**: Easily manage employee accounts and assign role-based permissions for different models, knowledge bases, and features through a unified admin backend.\n- **Fully Private Deployment**: Deploy the entire backend service on your on-premises servers or private cloud, ensuring your data remains 100% private and under your control to meet the strictest security and compliance standards.\n- **Reliable Backend Services**: Provides stable API services, enterprise-grade data backup and recovery mechanisms to ensure business continuity.\n\n## ‚ú® Online Demo\n\n> üöß **Public Beta Notice**\n>\n> The Enterprise Edition is currently in its early public beta stage, and we are actively iterating and optimizing its features. We are aware that it may not be perfectly stable yet.
