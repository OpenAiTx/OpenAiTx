Moreover, a part of the questions requires graduate-level perceptual and domain-specific knowledge, elevating the benchmark's difficulty and depth. \nExamples include:\n\n![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR/main/assets/example.png)\n\nThe metadata for MMAR is available in [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR/main/MMAR-meta.json). Unlike previous benchmarks, MMAR not only covers traditional modalities such as speech, audio, and music, but also extends to their mix, collected from in-the-wild videos. The distribution of data across these modalities is illustrated in the left figure. Furthermore, each question is annotated with a designated category and sub-category, as shown in the right figure.\n\nFor each question, we also provide the URL and corresponding timestamp of the original video, as well as the spoken language (if present) in the clip. To prevent potential data leakage into training for reasoning models, we have withheld reasoning cues and chain-of-thought annotations, which will be released at an appropriate time.\n\n<p float=\"left\">\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR/main/assets/modality_pie.png\" width=\"49%\" />\n  <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ddlBoJack/MMAR/main/assets/category_sunburst.png\" width=\"49%\" />\n</p>\n\n## Benchmark Results\nWe benchmark the models on MMAR across five model categories: \n1.
