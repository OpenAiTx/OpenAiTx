**Open Feedback** is an open SaaS platform for organizers and speakers to gather user feedback. It connects to one of 3 data sources: OpenFeedback database, hoverboard-v2, or your own API, to retrieve all the sessions & speakers. Anonymous users can give constructive feedback on sessions, and admins can manage the voting form, comments, languages, sessions and speakers directly within the GUI. Organizations also have centralized user management and a common voting form.
