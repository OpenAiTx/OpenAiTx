## Article Introduction

In the field of software development, version control of source code is extremely important. Unlike centralized version control systems such as Subversion or TFS, Git is a distributed version control system, bringing many advantages in version control and solving the shortcomings of traditional centralized version control, such as supporting local operations, easy backup, powerful and flexible branching and merging, etc. However, since both the concepts and tools of Git version control differ greatly from traditional centralized tools, this creates a significant learning curve. In the next 30 days, I hope to help everyone fully understand the essence of Git version control, and organize my learning insights as well as the problems and solutions our company encountered during the migration from Subversion to Git.
