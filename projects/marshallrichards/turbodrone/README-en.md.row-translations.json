Only ~$50 to have a 1080p camera for FPV and recording, tiny downward-facing optical flow sensor for position and altitude hold, and a well-tuned flight profile out-of-the-box. The only problem with drones like this is that they run closed-source firmware and are locked to only being controlled by a custom mobile app. I thought it would be cool to free some of these drones from their \"jail\" and write an API and client for accessing the video feed and sending control commands down to the drone by reverse-engineering how the mobile apps work. That way you can turn a highly capable $50 \"toy\" drone into something that can be programmatically controlled and used for all sorts of applications and experiments.",
