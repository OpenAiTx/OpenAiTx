The coarsest injection scale equals 1. \n\nAdvanced option: Specify quantization_flag to be True, to re-train *only* the injection level of the model, to get a on a color-quantized version of upsampled generated images from the previous scale. For some images, this might lead to more realistic results.\n\n### Super Resolution\nTo super resolve an image, please run:\n```\npython SR.py --input_name <LR_image_file_name>\n```\nThis will automatically train a SinGAN model correspond to 4x upsampling factor (if not exist already).\nFor different SR factors, please specify it using the parameter `--sr_factor` when calling the function.\nSinGAN's results on the BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.\n\n## Additional Data and Functions\n\n### Single Image Fréchet Inception Distance (SIFID score)\nTo calculate the SIFID between real images and their corresponding fake samples, please run:\n```\npython SIFID/sifid_score.py --path2real <real images path> --path2fake <fake images path> \n```  \nMake sure that each of the fake images file name is identical to its corresponding real image file name. Images should be saved in `.jpg` format.\n\n### Super Resolution Results\nSinGAN's SR results on the BSD100 dataset can be download from the 'Downloads' folder.\n\n### User Study\nThe data used for the user study can be found in the Downloads folder. \n\nreal folder: 50 real images, randomly picked from the [places database](http://places.csail.mit.edu/)\n\nfake_high_variance folder: random samples starting from n=N for each of the real images \n\nfake_mid_variance folder: random samples starting from n=N-1 for each of the real images \n\nFor additional details please see section 3.1 in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.01164.pdf)\n",
