You may also optionally reduce `VPP Voltage` to `12.50V`, depending on your EPROM's datasheet and programming success.\n\n![MiniPro Software Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafe72/27c160-tl866-adapter/master/images/minipro.jpg)\n\nThe EPROM can now be accessed as if it were a 27C4096 device, 512kB at a time, as configured by the DIP Switch:\n\n- **27C400:** program all 512kB in one pass.\n- **27C800:** program in 2 (two) 512kB passes.\n- **27C160:** program in 4 (four) 512kB passes.\n- **27C322:** program in 8 (eight) 512kB passes.\n\nRefer to the following table for DIP Switch configuration:\n\n![DIP Switch configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafe72/27c160-tl866-adapter/master/images/dip_config.png)\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you suffer write or verify errors when programming, try these steps:\n\n1. Make sure the EPROM is fully blank before programming it (`Device -> Blank Check`). All EPROMs available today are second-hand 'pulls'; sellers aren't always careful when erasing before resale.\n\n2. Open and close the adapter's ZIF lever a few times, and reposition the EPROM squarely in the socket.\n\n3. Try adjusting `VPP Voltage` between `12.50V` and `13.50V`. Subjectively, I have had greater success at the higher voltage, which gives headroom for voltage losses in transferring VPP through the adapter's logic.\n\n4. Programming errors will occur occasionally, and of course, the chances increase the larger the device. It makes sense to invest in a UV eraser. These are available at a low cost on eBay for around $15-20. Most devices will be erased after 10 to 20 minutes under UV light.\n\n5. [Maillouski](https://github.com/Maillouski/), reported that Xgpro v12.38 sets the default VDD Write value to 6.60V for the AT27C4096. To avoid programming issues, make sure you change this value to 3.30V.\n\n![IC Config Information VDD Write](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mafe72/27c160-tl866-adapter/master/images/vdd_3v30.png)\n\n6.
