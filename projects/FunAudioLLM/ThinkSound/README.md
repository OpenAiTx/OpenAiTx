**ThinkSound** is a unified Any2Audio generation framework with flow matching guided by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning.

PyTorch implementation for multimodal audio generation and editing: generate or edit audio from video, text, and audio, powered by step-by-step reasoning from Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).

## üöÄ Features

- **Any2Audio**: Generate audio from arbitrary modalities ‚Äî video, text, audio, or their combinations.
- **Video-to-Audio SOTA**: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple V2A benchmarks.
- **CoT-Driven Reasoning**: Chain-of-Thought reasoning for compositional and controllable audio generation via MLLMs.
- **Interactive Object-centric Editing**: Refine or edit specific sound events by clicking on visual objects or using text instructions.
- **Unified Framework**: One foundation model supports generation, editing, and interactive workflow.

## ‚ú® Method Overview

ThinkSound decomposes audio generation and editing into three interactive stages, all guided by MLLM-based Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning:

1. **Foley Generation:** Generate foundational, semantically and temporally aligned soundscapes from video.
2. **Object-Centric Refinement:** Refine or add sounds for user-specified objects via clicks or regions in the video.
3. **Targeted Audio Editing:** Modify generated audio using high-level natural language instructions.

<!-- A large-scale CoT-annotated dataset (**AudioCoT**) is used to train both the reasoning module and the unified audio foundation model.

## ‚ö° Quick Start

**Environment Preparation:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liuhuadai/ThinkSound.git
cd ThinkSound
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install -y -c conda-forge 'ffmpeg<7'
# Download pretrained weights https://huggingface.co/liuhuadai/ThinkSound to Directory ckpts/
# model weights can be also downloaded from https://www.modelscope.cn/models/iic/ThinkSound
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/liuhuadai/ThinkSound ckpts
```

**Make it executable**
```bash
chmod +x scripts/demo.sh
```

**Run the script**
```bash
./scripts/demo.sh <video_path> <caption> <CoT description>
```


### Web Interface Usage

For an interactive experience, launch the Gradio web interface:

```bash
python app.py
```

## üìù TODO

- ‚òê Release training scripts for ThinkSound models
- ‚òê Open-source AudioCoT dataset and automated pipeline
- ‚òê Provide detailed documentation and API reference
- ‚òê Add support for additional modalities and downstream tasks
