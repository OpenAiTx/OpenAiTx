This chess curriculum system, specially designed for young people, is led by "Nine-Time Champion" Tang Dan. It forms a complete teaching loop from board recognition to advanced tactics. The course starts with basic piece movement and capturing techniques, covering detailed rules for the seven major pieces such as pawn, cannon, rook, horse, etc., and builds foundational chess theory through practical scenarios like responding to check and game judgment.
The classic opening module analyzes the deployment logic of the three mainstream tactics: Central Cannon, Flying Elephant, and Immortal Points the Way, combined with endgame skills to tackle classic scenarios like single pawn checkmate and horse capturing single advisor. The checkmate training unit systematically deconstructs 32 winning combinations such as Double Cannons, Horse in the Pit, and Iron Bolt, with calculation exercises to enhance tactical thinking. The defensive system covers core strategies like piece protection, space control, and exchanging to relieve pressure. Middle-game tactics incorporate practical skills such as double attack, diversion, and blitz, with 40 classic cases to demonstrate the subtlety of attack and defense transitions.
