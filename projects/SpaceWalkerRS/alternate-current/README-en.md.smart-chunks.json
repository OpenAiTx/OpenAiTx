    "Content": "\nFor an individual wire, these two optimizations are the best you can do, but for an entire grid, you can do better!\n\nSince we calculate the power of the entire network, sending block and shape updates to the wires in it is redundant. Removing those updates can reduce the number of block and shape updates by up to 20%.\n\n(3)\nTo make the order of block updates to neighbors of a network deterministic, the first thing we must do is to replace the location- dependent order in which a wire updates its neighbors. Instead, we base it on the direction of power flow. This part of the algorithm was heavily inspired by theosib's 'RedstoneWireTurbo', which you can read more about in theosib's comment on Mojira [here](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-81098?focusedCommentId=420777&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-420777) or by checking out its implementation in carpet mod [here](https://github.com/gnembon/fabric-carpet/blob/master/src/main/java/carpet/helpers/RedstoneWireTurbo.java).\n\nThe idea is to determine the direction of power flow through a wire based on the power it receives from neighboring wires. For example, if the only power a wire receives is from a neighboring wire to its west, it can be said that the direction of power flow through the wire is east.\n\nWe make the order of block updates to neighbors of a wire depend on what is determined to be the direction of power flow. This not only removes locationality entirely, it even removes directionality in a large number of cases. Unlike in 'RedstoneWireTurbo', however, I have decided to keep a directional element in ambiguous cases, rather than to introduce randomness, though this is trivial to change.\n\nWhile this change fixes the block update order of individual wires, we must still address the overall block update order of a network. This turns out to be a simple fix, because of a change we made earlier: we search through the network for wires that receive power from outside it, and spread the power from there. If we make each wire transmit its power to neighboring wires in an order dependent on the direction of power flow, we end up with a non-locational and largely non-directional wire update order.\n",

For example, if the only power a wire receives is from a neighboring wire to its west, it can be said that the direction of power flow through the wire is east.\n\nWe make the order of block updates to neighbors of a wire depend on what is determined to be the direction of power flow. This not only removes locationality entirely, it even removes directionality in a large number of cases. Unlike in 'RedstoneWireTurbo', however, I have decided to keep a directional element in ambiguous cases, rather than to introduce randomness, though this is trivial to change.\n\nWhile this change fixes the block update order of individual wires, we must still address the overall block update order of a network. This turns out to be a simple fix, because of a change we made earlier: we search through the network for wires that receive power from outside it, and spread the power from there. If we make each wire transmit its power to neighboring wires in an order dependent on the direction of power flow, we end up with a non-locational and largely non-directional wire update order.\n\n",
