**Lost in a code maze? Tired of tedious context prep for AI collaboration? Folda-Scan to the rescue!** 💡

**Folda-Scan** is a revolutionary intelligent project Q&A tool that **runs entirely locally in your browser**. It transforms your codebase into a conversational partner using advanced semantic vectorization, making code comprehension and AI collaboration unprecedentedly simple and secure.

Folda-Scan (as part of the [WebFS-Toolkit](https://github.com/oldjs/web-code-agent)) is built with cutting-edge web technologies and AI algorithms to offer you a smooth, efficient, and secure local code interaction experience.

### ✨ Key Highlights (Why Folda-Scan?)

- 🛡️ **Absolute Privacy, Local Execution**: All data processing happens locally in your browser; your code **never leaves** your machine.
- 💬 **"Chat" with Code in Natural Language**: Ask questions about your codebase as if talking to a colleague and get precise answers.
- 🧠 **Deep Semantic Understanding**: Goes beyond keywords to grasp the true intent and complex logic within your code.
- 🎯 **Pinpoint Information Instantly**: Quickly locate relevant code snippets and files, even with vague descriptions.
- 🤖 **LLM Collaboration Accelerator**: Generate context-aware Markdown with one click, perfectly "feeding" AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.).
- 💰 **Slash Token Costs**: Optimize LLM interactions, significantly reducing API call expenses and latency.
- 🛠️ **Smart Config Generation**: Assists in creating project configuration files like `Dockerfile`.
- 🚀 **Instant Onboarding**: Clear guidance to kickstart your code exploration journey quickly.

### 🚀 How It Works

Folda-Scan's magic comes from its innovative **semantic vectorization engine**:

1.  **Local Scanning & Indexing**: Securely scans your selected local project, converting code into high-dimensional vectors via semantic analysis, building a knowledge index locally in your browser.
2.  **Intelligent Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understands your natural language questions and converts them into vectors too.
3.  **Precise Semantic Matching**: Efficiently matches question vectors with code content in the vector space to provide the most relevant answers.
    _All done efficiently in your browser, with your data privacy fully protected._

### 🛠️ Tech Unveiled (Tech Stack)

- **Core Framework:** [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/)
- **Local File Interaction:** [File System Access API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File_System_Access_API)
- **AI & NLP:** Advanced Semantic Vector Analysis, Natural Language Processing Algorithms
- **Main Language:** [JavaScript/TypeScript - please specify]
  ### 🏁 Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended v16+ or v18+, refer to `package.json`)
- npm (Version per `package.json`, e.g., npm@10.x.x) / yarn / pnpm
- A modern browser supporting File System Access API (e.g., latest Chrome, Edge)

### 💡 Basic Usage

1.  **Select Folder**: Authorize browser access to your local code project.
2.  **Wait for Indexing**: Folda-Scan will quickly build a semantic index locally.
3.  **Start Asking**: Query your codebase in natural language and unveil its secrets!
