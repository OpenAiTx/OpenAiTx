The app offers two APK versions, please choose according to your usage habits:  

- `default`: The app icon is shown by default after installation. You can hide the icon in settings, but this feature may not work perfectly on some Android systems.   
- `icon-disabled`: The app icon is hidden by default after installation. If you mainly use this app through the "share" function of other apps, this version is recommended. You can still enter the app settings to unhide the icon.
