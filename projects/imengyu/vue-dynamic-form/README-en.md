## Introduction

The design is inspired by [Alibaba's XRender](https://xrender.fun/form-render).

In backend development, we often use forms to submit data, and form submissions take up most of the development time. When there are many forms, manually writing form components becomes a very troublesome task. vue-dynamic-form is created to solve this problem. It allows you to dynamically generate forms using JSON data. You only need to pass in a JSON object containing various descriptive information to render a complete form.

vue-dynamic-form is not an essential tool for development; it's just a small component to help you speed up your development process.

All backend projects in the author's company have adopted dynamic forms, saving 80% of the time spent on form layout and significantly improving development efficiency (which means more time to slack off ü§≠). Now, vue-dynamic-form is open-sourced, hoping to make your development easier.
