Please do not post any AADisplay tutorial-related videos and pictures in public places, otherwise I will stop updating in regions other than China.

Let Android Auto display any application, a nested scheme based on VirtualDisplay, Star! Star! Star!

Only supports A12+, requires LSPosed, some ROMs may have the possibility of crashing, please be prepared with rescue knowledge.

Theoretically can support up to A10+, but due to lack of devices and too much maintenance effort, it is not supported, please PR if capable.

Do not submit Issues unrelated to this project, mandatory close! For example: Magisk/LSPosed environment installation, AA cannot connect/use and other related issues.

-----

## Usage
- Enable this module in LSPosed, check System Framework and Android Auto, install your favorite launcher, and fill in the package name in the module settings.
- It is recommended to set DPI, which will improve annoying apps that use application context to draw UI.
- Add Properties related to AA parameters to hook and modify AA configurations, only supports basic type parameters.
- Automatically bypass Android Auto's check on the installation source of AA apps themselves.
- Root permissions are only used to execute user-configured Shell commands, no need to grant if not required.
