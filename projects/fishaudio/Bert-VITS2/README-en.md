## 【Project Recommendation】
# The brand new autoregressive TTS under FishAudio [Fish-Speech](https://github.com/fishaudio/fish-speech) is now available, with results at the current open-source SOTA level, and is continuously maintained. It is recommended to use this project as a replacement for BV2/GSV. This project will no longer be maintained in the short term.
## Demo Video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV18E421371Q
## Tech slides Video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1zJ4m1K7cj
## Please note, the core idea of this project originates from [anyvoiceai/MassTTS](https://github.com/anyvoiceai/MassTTS), a very good TTS project
## The demo of MassTTS is [AI version Fengge sharp review of Fengge himself, and recovered the lost kidney in the Golden Triangle](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1w24y1c7z9)

[//]: # (This repository originated from a friend sharing an AI Fengge video, I was amazed by the effects. After trying MassTTS myself, I found fs has some gap in sound quality compared to vits, and the training pipeline is more complex than vits. Therefore, following its idea, I integrated bert)

## Experienced travelers/pioneers/captains/doctors/sensei/demon hunters/miaomiaoLu/V should refer to the code and learn how to train by themselves.
