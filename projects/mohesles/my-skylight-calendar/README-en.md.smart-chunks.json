Therefore I went with the hardware described below.\nNevertheless, you case might be different and will need you to adjust it as needed, for example if you want to display it on a tablet or something else.\n\nThe hardware I originally used I chose based on what I mentioned above plus with the hope to be able to extend functionality using the webcam, speaker and microphone.

This might not be the case now, so use whatever display works for you. Tablet, touchscreen, phone, whatever. The main thing youll need to edit is the dashboard.\n\n",
