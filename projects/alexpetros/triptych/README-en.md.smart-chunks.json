It aims to demonstrate the efficacy of these\nproposals, to advocate for their addition to the HTML standard, and to provide that functionality as\na polyfill until then. Its design is primarily inspired by [htmx](https://htmx.org/) and\n[htmz](https://leanrada.com/htmz/).\n\nBecause the goal of Triptych is to be incorporated into the HTML standard, it does not use namespaced custom attributes (like `ng-*`, `hx-*`, and so on), but instead uses existing (or plausible) HTML standard attributes in a backwards compatible manner.\nMuch of the script's complexity results from the need to not break existing uses of attributes like `target` or `method`.\n\n\n## Installation\n\nThere is no CDN yet, but even if I upload it to one, [you probably shouldn't use it](https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/why-not-javascript-cdn).\n\nInstead, install it like this:\n\n1. Copy `triptych.js` to a folder in your project, i.e. `/vendor/triptych-0.1.0.js`\n1. Serve it at that URL with a really long cache time (I usually set it to a year)\n1. Include it in your document like this:\n",
