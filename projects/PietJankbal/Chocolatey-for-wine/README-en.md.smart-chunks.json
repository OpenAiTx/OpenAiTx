Use Shift^Ctrl^C instead.\n  - Selecting text in the ConEmu window (for copy/paste) doesn't highlight the selection. Included is a very sad hack       against recent wine versions that works around this, so highlighting should just work now.\n   \nAbout winetricks(.ps1):\n\n- If you don't call it ('winetricks' in powershell-console) , nothing gets downloaded so no overhead there. \n- A lot of verbs (like powershell 5.1) need a few essential files to extract stuff from msu packages. Installing these essential files requires first huge downloads , and  takes lots of time during 1st time usage. But after things are cached it goes quickly . For example if you might wanna try 'winetricks ps51' first, it will take about  approx. 15 minutes. Some other verbs might take 5 minutes on first time usage. But after you called a verb once this nuisance is gone.\n- Files are cached in directory MyDocuments. If you call all verbs it'll take about 800 MB there.\n- Hopefully some better 64-bit support for various verbs.\n- Possibility to extract a file and (try) install from an msu file. Do 'winetricks install_dll_from_msu' to see how.\n- A rudimentary Powershell 5.1.\n- experimental dotnet481 installation, and dotnet35 (might be needed by apps not satisfied with current dotnet48 installation).\n- Autotab-completion. Note: while using multiple verbs from command line they have to be seperated by a comma\n  from now on (this is how powershell handles multiple arguments)\n  So 'winetricks riched20 gdiplus' won't work anymore, use 'winetricks riched20,gdiplus' instead\n- Some programs fail to install/run when you try them via Chocolatey due to wine-bugs. I added a few workarounds in winetricks for them, see below.\n- Special verbs (winetricks vs19, vs22 and vs22_interactive_installer) to install working Visual Studio Community 2019 and 2022 (see screenshot, >10 mins to install and requires approx. 10GB!, after install start devenv.exe from directory c:\\Program\\ Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\Common7\\IDE/)\n  ![screenshot](https://github.com/PietJankbal/Chocolatey-for-wine/assets/26839562/d576a619-c752-4eb1-81c2-6f6b66b50ff6)\n- Special verb to get access to various unix commands like grep,sed, file, less, curl etc. etc. (winetricks git.portable, Disclaimer: some commands do not yet work due to wine bugs\n- Also included a few powershell scripts adapted from codesnippets found on the internet:\n    - How to embed an exe in a powershell script via Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection (the exe won't show up in tasklist).\n    - How to make fancy messageboxes\n    - Convert a powershell script (ps1) into an exe.\n    - And a few other\n \n     \nAbout system programs:\n\nFeature is added to replace simple system programs like for example setx.exe by a function in\nc:\\\\Program Files\\Powershell\\7\\profile.ps1. Or add system programs that are missing like getmac.exe.\nIf programs fail because of insufficient mature or missing system programs one could write a ",

Use Shift^Ctrl^C instead.\n  - Selecting text in the ConEmu window (for copy/paste) doesn't highlight the selection. Included is a very sad hack       against recent wine versions that works around this, so highlighting should just work now.\n   \nAbout winetricks(.ps1):\n\n- If you don't call it ('winetricks' in powershell-console) , nothing gets downloaded so no overhead there. \n- A lot of verbs (like powershell 5.1) need a few essential files to extract stuff from msu packages. Installing these essential files requires first huge downloads , and  takes lots of time during 1st time usage. But after things are cached it goes quickly . For example if you might wanna try 'winetricks ps51' first, it will take about  approx. 15 minutes. Some other verbs might take 5 minutes on first time usage. But after you called a verb once this nuisance is gone.\n- Files are cached in directory MyDocuments. If you call all verbs it'll take about 800 MB there.\n- Hopefully some better 64-bit support for various verbs.\n- Possibility to extract a file and (try) install from an msu file.

Note: while using multiple verbs from command line they have to be seperated by a comma\n  from now on (this is how powershell handles multiple arguments)\n  So 'winetricks riched20 gdiplus' won't work anymore, use 'winetricks riched20,gdiplus' instead\n- Some programs fail to install/run when you try them via Chocolatey due to wine-bugs. I added a few workarounds in winetricks for them, see below.\n- Special verbs (winetricks vs19, vs22 and vs22_interactive_installer) to install working Visual Studio Community 2019 and 2022 (see screenshot, >10 mins to install and requires approx. 10GB!, after install start devenv.exe from directory c:\\Program\\ Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio\\2019\\Community\\Common7\\IDE/)\n  ![screenshot](https://github.com/PietJankbal/Chocolatey-for-wine/assets/26839562/d576a619-c752-4eb1-81c2-6f6b66b50ff6)\n- Special verb to get access to various unix commands like grep,sed, file, less, curl etc. etc. (winetricks git.portable, Disclaimer: some commands do not yet work due to wine bugs\n- Also included a few powershell scripts adapted from codesnippets found on the internet:\n    - How to embed an exe in a powershell script via Invoke-ReflectivePEInjection (the exe won't show up in tasklist).\n    - How to make fancy messageboxes\n    - Convert a powershell script (ps1) into an exe.\n    - And a few other\n \n     \nAbout system programs:\n\nFeature is added to replace simple system programs like for example setx.exe by a function in\nc:\\\\Program Files\\Powershell\\7\\profile.ps1.
