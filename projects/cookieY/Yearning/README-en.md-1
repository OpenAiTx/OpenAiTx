Focused on privacy and efficiency, it provides an intuitive and secure environment for MYSQL auditing.\n\n---\n[![OSCS Status](https://www.oscs1024.com/platform/badge/cookieY/Yearning.svg?size=small)](https://www.murphysec.com/dr/nDuoncnUbuFMdrZsh7)\n![Platform Support](https://img.shields.io/badge/-x86_x64%20ARM%20Supports%20%E2%86%92-rgb(84,56,255)?style=flat-square&logoColor=white&logo=linux)\n[![][github-license-shield]][github-license-link]\n![GitHub top language](https://img.shields.io/github/languages/top/cookieY/Yearning?color=369eff&label=golang&labelColor=black&logo=golang&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)\n[![][github-forks-shield]][github-forks-link]\n[![][github-stars-shield]][github-stars-link]\n[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/cookieY/Yearning/total?labelColor=black&logo=download&logoColor=white&style=flat-square)](https://github.com/cookieY/Yearning/releases/latest)\n\nEnglish | [简体中文](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cookieY/Yearning/next/README.zh-CN.md) | [日本語](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cookieY/Yearning/next/README.ja-JP.md)\n\n## ✨ Features\n\n- **AI Assistant**: Our AI assistant offers real-time SQL optimization suggestions, enhancing SQL performance. It also supports text-to-SQL conversion, allowing users to input natural language and receive optimized SQL statements.\n  \n- **SQL Audit**: Create SQL audit tickets with approval workflows and automated syntax checks. Validate SQL statements for correctness, security, and compliance. Rollback statements are automatically generated for DDL/DML operations, with a comprehensive history log for traceability.\n\n- **Query Audit**: Audit user queries, restrict data sources and databases, and anonymize sensitive fields. Query records are saved for future reference.\n\n- **Check Rules**: Our automated syntax checker supports a wide range of check rules, suitable for most automatic checking scenarios.\n\n- **Privacy Focused**: Yearning is a locally deployable, open-source solution that ensures the security of your database and SQL statements. It includes encryption mechanisms to protect sensitive data, ensuring it remains secure even if unauthorized access occurs.\n\n- **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**: Create and manage roles with specific permissions, restricting access to query work orders, auditing functions, and other sensitive operations based on user roles.\n\n> \\[!TIP]\n> For more detailed information, visit our [Yearning Guide](https://next.yearning.io)\n\n\n## ⚙️ Installation\n\nDownload the [latest release](https://github.com/cookieY/Yearning/releases/latest) and extract it.
