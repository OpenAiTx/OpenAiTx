## 🚀 Why I Built This Module

*I noticed a lot of people either selling leaked keyboxes or paying for modules that claim to pass strong Play Integrity but only offer leaked keyboxes. I created this module to give you **real**, **working keyboxes** completely **free**, no hidden charges, no scams, just **legit access** along with several useful features. 🚫🔑*

### 🛡️ App Signing & Security Clarification

In earlier versions, the app was signed using a **test key**, which caused some security detectors to flag it as a potentially harmful app.

Starting from **Module v3+**, the app is now signed with a **private release key**.  
🔒 Although there were **no changes in functionality**, switching to a proper key has resolved the issue, there are **no more false detections** reported.

### 🐾 Purpose of Meow Assistant

**Meow Assistant** is built to enhance usability and transparency.

It provides **popup messages** when:

- ✅ You click on any option inside the **WebView**  
- ⚙️ You execute any script via the **Action button**

This helps you stay informed about the actions being triggered and improves the overall user experience.

- Unable to grant root access to apps? `Disable` the IntegrityBox module, it will switch shamiko/nohello to `blacklist mode` and unhide the root  
- [Shamiko](https://t.me/LSPosed/292) does not work with magisk delta (kitsune mask)  
- [Shamiko](https://t.me/LSPosed/292) only works with [Zygisk Next](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/ZygiskNext/releases)  
- Hide root properly if play integrity isn't passing for you. If you are using a custom rom, make sure you have disabled inbuilt gms spoofing. How to disable it? Well it depends on what rom you're using. Join your rom help group & ask `how to disable it` there.  
- Switch to [Magisk Alpha](https://t.me/magiskalpha/683) if you're having integrity issue with official magisk.

_I originally wrote this code in Notepad and haven’t been very active on GitHub. I’m uploading it here mainly to keep things transparent. Feel free to inspect the code._

`Happy debugging!`
