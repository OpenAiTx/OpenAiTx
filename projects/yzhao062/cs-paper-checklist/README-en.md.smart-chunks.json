While some items are subjective, the goal is to provide concrete reminders and highlight common pitfalls. It is a living document and will continue to be updated based on feedback._\n\n---\n\n## 1. 🎯 Title and Abstract\n\n- [ ] 1.1 Title is ≤ 15 words. Check for generic phrasing (e.g., “A Novel Framework...,” which conveys little information) and overly narrow focus (which may reduce the paper’s audience)—aim for concise but informative.\n- [ ] 1.2 Title clearly reflects both the **problem** and the **solution**, and includes at least one technical keyword (e.g., jailbreak, OOD detection, graph learning).\n- [ ] 1.3 Title avoids rare or ambiguous abbreviations. Terms like LLM, AI, and ML are acceptable in CS venues, but avoid abbreviations like AD (which could refer to advertisement or anomaly detection).\n- [ ] 1.4 Abstract includes at least four key components: (1) problem/task definition, (2) proposed method or idea, (3) main results, and (4) broader impact or significance (some may be combined).\n- [ ] 1.5 Abstract avoids undefined abbreviations and vague descriptors (e.g., “important,” “novel,” “state-of-the-art” without context).\n- [ ] 1.6 Bonus: Abstract includes at least one concrete, quantitative result or insight to make the work stand out. For instance, “our method achieves 11.2× acceleration in test-time inference for jailbreak detection.”\n\n\n---\n\n## 2. 📚 Introduction\n\n- [ ] 2.1 The main problem or task is clearly defined within the first two paragraphs.\n- [ ] 2.2 Motivation includes either (a) real-world use cases or (b) citations to prior work—ideally both.\n- [ ] 2.3 The introduction ends with a brief overview of the proposed method and its name.\n- [ ] 2.4 Contributions are explicitly itemized (e.g., “(1) first framework for ..., (2) new dataset for ..., (3) extensive evaluation on ...”).\n- [ ] 2.5 Each contribution is specific and verifiable—avoid vague claims such as “we provide insights” or “we improve understanding.”\n- [ ] 2.6 Bonus: Include a compelling figure on the first page—e.g., comparison to prior work, performance highlight, or visual explanation of the core idea.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 3. 🔍 Related Work\n\n- [ ] 3.1 All cited works are connected to your method, baseline, or task.\n- [ ] 3.2 At least one baseline from the top-3 most cited recent papers on the topic is mentioned.\n- [ ] 3.3 Related work does not exceed 1.5 pages (unless survey-style paper).\n- [ ] 3.4 You may use LLMs for searching the related work, but double triple check each of the paper -- do not trust LLMs!!!!\n- [ ] 3.5 Bonus: use related work section to introduce baseline algorithms -- show a table for your proposal better than the existing ones\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 4. 🧪 Method\n\n- [ ] 4.1 All symbols are defined before use.\n- [ ] 4.2 Each equation is referenced with inline explanation (e.g., “Eq. (3) defines the loss over…”). If an equation is never referenced, consider making it inline to save space.\n- [ ] 4.3 All modules or components of the method are illustrated or described in text or figures.\n- [ ] 4.4 Each subsection ideally aligns with parts of the overview figure. Add a short summary paragraph before diving into subsections.\n- [ ] 4.5 You do not need both overview figure and pseudo code in the main text -- move the pseudo code to the appendix\n- [ ] 4.6 The method is reproducible without referring to the appendix or external code—reviewers should understand everything from the main text.\n- [ ] 4.7 Bonus: Can anything be removed from this section without reducing clarity? Do not hesitate to cut: more math ≠ better paper.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 5. 📊 Experiments\n\n- [ ] 5.1 At least 3 datasets are used (unless the paper introduces a new dataset).\n- [ ] 5.2 At least 3 baseline methods are compared. Are they state-of-the-art? Justify why these baselines are chosen.\n- [ ] 5.3 At least 1 ablation study is included.\n- [ ] 5.4 Standard deviation or confidence intervals are reported where appropriate.\n- [ ] 5.5 Hardware environment, software libraries, and hyperparameter settings are described.\n- [ ] 5.6 Negative results (if any) are explained, not omitted—failure cases are valuable.\n- [ ] 5.7 Evaluation metrics are clearly defined and justified.\n- [ ] 5.8 All figures and tables are referenced in the main text.\n- [ ] 5.9 Beyond showing numbers and saying “we perform well,” at least one deeper insight or analysis is provided (e.g., why it works, where it fails).\n- [ ] 5.10 Bonus: Think about how easy others can reproduce your work? If you have any \"dirty tricks\" -- remove them pls.\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 6. 🧾 Writing Quality and Style\n\n- [ ] 6.1 All abbreviations are defined at first use (even ML, LLM, etc.) -- do not redefine them again and again.\n- [ ] 6.2 No sentence exceeds 25 words without a comma or period.\n- [ ] 6.3 No paragraph exceeds 10 lines.\n- [ ] 6.4 Passive voice usage < 30% of the total number of sentences.\n- [ ] 6.5 Bonus: Have you noticed that your paper are full of the fancy LLM words, like encompass, intricate, etc?\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n## 7. 🖼️ Figures and Tables\n\n- [ ] 7.1 Each figure/table has a caption ≥ 2 lines that includes interpretation or context.
