Please use the [sample configuration file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/a-bali/janitor/master/config.yml) and change it according to your needs, following the comments in the file. Most of the variables are optional and have reasonable defaults, for details please see the comments. You can reference environment variables with `$ENV_VAR` or `${ENV_VAR}` which will be substituted by their value if they exist (or with an empty string if they don't.).\n\nA minimal but already operational configuration can be as short as follows (assuming Janitor's web interface will be available on its default port which is 8080):\n\n    monitor:\n      mqtt:\n        server: mymqtt.server\n        targets:\n        - topic: \"/sensors/#\"\n    alert:\n      gotify:\n        server: \"http://mygotify.server:1234\"\n        token: gotify_token\n\nOnce you created a configuration file, Janitor can be launched as follows:\n\n    $ janitor path/to/your/configfile.yml\n\nJanitor will log to standard output. The log is viewable on the web interface as well, where you can delete monitored targets and reload the configuration file (e.g. in case you added new targets or changed any of the settings).\n\nJanitor will not daemonize itself. It is recommended to create a systemd service for janitor in case you want it running continuously.\n\n## Running with Docker\n\nThe latest version of Janitor is available on Docker Hub [`abali/janitor`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/abali/janitor).
