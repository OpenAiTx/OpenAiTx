The application is built using a modern tech stack, including React, NestJS, and Python FastAPI for the REI-S service.\n\nUsers can interact with assistants through a user-friendly interface. Depending on the assistant's configuration, users may be able to ask questions, upload their own files, or use other features. The assistants interact with various LLM providers to provide responses based on the configured extensions. Contextual information provided by the configured extensions allows the assistants to answer domain-specific questions and provide relevant information.\n\nThe application is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to create assistants with different capabilities by adding extensions.\n\n![short demo video of basic usage](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecentric/c4-genai-suite/main/demo/preview.webp)\n\n## Features\n\n### Large Language Models (LLM) and Multimodal Models\n\nThe c4 GenAI Suite supports already many models directly. And if your preferred model is not supported already, it should be easy to write an extension to support it.\n\n* OpenAI compatible models\n* Azure OpenAI models\n* Bedrock models\n* Google GenAI models\n* Ollama compatible models\n",

The default login credentials are user `admin@example.com` and password `secret`.\n\n![video showing assistant configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecentric/c4-genai-suite/main/demo/assistants.webp)\n\n### Using Helm & Kubernetes\n\nFor deployment in Kubernetes environments, please refer to the [README of our Helm Chart](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecentric/c4-genai-suite/main/./helm-chart/README.md).\n\n### Setting up Assistants and Extensions\n\nThe c4 GenAI Suite revolves around *assistants*.\nEach assistant consists of a set of extensions, which determine the LLM model and which tools it can use.\n\n- In the admin area (click the username on the bottom left), go to the [assistants section](http://localhost:3333/admin/assistants).\n- Add an assistant with the green `+` button next to the section title. Choose a name and a description.\n- Select the created assistant and click the green `+ Add Extension`.\n- Select the model and fill in the credentials.\n- Use the `Test` Button to check that it works and `save`.\n\nNow you can return to the [chat page](http://localhost:3333/chat) (click on `c4 GenAI Suite` in the top left) and start a new conversation with your new assistant.\n\n> [!TIP]\n> Our `docker-compose` includes a local Ollama, which runs on the CPU. You can use this for quick testing. But it will be slow and you probably want to use another model.
