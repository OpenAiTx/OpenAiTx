### Preface

- **Please use scientific internet access functions correctly, for researching literature, watching American TV shows, etc.;**
- **⭐It is forbidden and not recommended to visit some IQ-lowering XX websites; please be cautious (do not press x).⭐**
- **The content of this repository is purely for learning purposes and only for communication and discussion among friends;**
- **Due to the complexity of the internet environment, experiences vary greatly across regions, ISPs, and time periods; please try by yourself;**
- **Protect your privacy, try not to fill in your real personal information when registering for VPNs;**
- **The internet is not a lawless zone, please act cautiously! Study hard and progress every day.**

**If you are currently using a VPN and have a good experience, it is not recommended to spend too much time searching for other VPNs; there is no need to waste time, energy, and money chasing so-called "top-tier VPNs."**

Foreword: This list is updated in real-time with the latest price charts and changes in VPN usage rankings, only providing the best user experience. It is sorted from high to low in terms of stability and VPN service quality, with poorly performing VPNs regularly removed!
Gamers, please use dedicated game accelerators; it is not recommended to use VPNs for gaming. Wish everyone finds their ideal VPN soon!
------
#### Why not recommend using VPNs for gaming? Imagine a scenario where someone next to you is downloading a huge file while you are gaming; it will definitely lag you out, so games need professional accelerators.

#### Removed VPNs: Supercar (shut down), Meizhiyuan (VPN owner slacking), Futrue Network (poor user experience), Uni Cloud (constantly attacked, thus removed), xsus Chicken Farm (major issues in July 2023, unfriendly user experience), Godetia (too expensive, not included), Freejump (not very cost-effective, few node locations), Sese Station, ACA (stopped new registrations, thus removed), SOCK BOOM (owner arrested on 2024.1.27, shut down), Magic Ring (too many users, large scale, poor experience during peak hours), puppy VPN owner slacking
