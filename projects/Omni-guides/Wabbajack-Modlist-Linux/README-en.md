DISCLAIMER - I am not affiliated with the Wabbajack group in any way, just a gamer trying to help other gamers. You may be able to get assistance with this guide from the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the main [Official Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack), but it may be best to @ me on Discord (@omni). Due to this being an unofficial guide, assistance on this from Wabbajack support directly, or the Modlist developers, is highly unlikely.

## Introduction

The contained guides are a work in progress, based mostly on my own tests and collaboration with multiple users posting in the #unofficial-linux-help channel of the [Official Wabbajack Discord](https://discord.gg/wabbajack). With thanks to all involved. Feedback is always welcome.

Please note that Pull Requests to this github for small issues may have the suggested change applied without performing a merge. Please create an Issue describing the correction instead.

### Wabbajack Application

You can now run Wabbajack itself on Linux (Both SteamOS/Deck and other distros) via Proton or Wine. Configuring via Proton is the preferred method because it should be the same for any platform that has Steam. If you really prefer not to, then you can use base Wine (not Steam Deck).

### Automated Configuration

While the guides include the step by step process to get a Modlist up and running, I have created an Automated Modlist Install script, with the aim of drastically reducing the work needed to get up and running. Currently, the Automation script takes care of around 90% of the steps needed.

If you wish to carry out the steps manually because you want to learn the process, or simply enjoy tinkering, then absolutely feel free to follow the steps contained in each guide. Otherwise, you can find the Automation Script and instructions for use here - [Using the Omni-Guides Automation Script](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/Using-the-omni%E2%80%90guides.sh-Automation-Script).

### Manual Configuration
The steps included in each guide have been used to get Wabbajack Modlists running on Linux, but not the Wabbajack application itself. As it stands, there is currently **no way** to run Wabbajack itself on Linux - the best efforts so far still result in instability and lack of function. With the steps in this guide, I have confirmed success with Modlists for Skyrim, Fallout 4, Oblivion, Fallout New Vegas, and more, and on platforms such as Steam Deck (SteamOS/Arch), Garuda Linux (Arch) and Fedora/Nobara - though the process should be largely the same for most Linux distros.

Steam Deck users can follow the Modlist-specific guides linked, to get step-by-step instructions to get you up and running for your chosen Modlist.

For general Linux systems (i.e. not the Steam Deck), you can follow either the modlist-specific guides listed, including those listed under the "PC Only" section, or follow the steps in the [General Linux](https://github.com/Omni-guides/Wabbajack-Modlist-Linux/wiki/General-Linux-Guide-(Anvil)) guide. This General Linux guide uses Anvil as an example list, but you can replace it with your Modlist of choice, the steps should be largely the same. If you have some issues, you could check the Modlist specific guides in case there are additional steps that may assist in running your chosen Modlist.

Finally, if you're a Modlist developer and you want me to test your Modlist, let me know! Happy gaming!
