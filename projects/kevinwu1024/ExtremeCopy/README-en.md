ExtremeCopy is a Windows utility which copies and moves files extremely fast, it will auto optimize speed and resources based on the target physical machine.

**ExtremeCopy includes the following features:**

   * Copy or move files or folders extremely fast.
   * Increase the file copying speed by 20% to 120% compared to the default Windows copying function.
   * Save much time when backing up huge files to another hard drive or USB drive.
   * Easily manage copying tasks.
   * Able to calculate and display remaining time exactly.
   * Supports Break Point which allows pausing when encountering any problems such as file being locked and resume back with a click on the "Continue" button once the problem is fixed.
   * Supports multiple languages.


For high performance purposes, all of the code is written in C++ and uses Win32 API directly.

ExtremeCopy uses email as bug report delivery to send dump files to itself, set up your email account in **BugReport.cpp** if you want to use it.

For legacy paid versions, there is a **RegisterCodeGenerator** project that can generate register codes for it.
