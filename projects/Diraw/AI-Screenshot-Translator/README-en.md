# AI Screenshot Translator

[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/) [![Nuitka](https://img.shields.io/badge/Nuitka-Compiled-purple)](https://nuitka.net/) [![Release Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Release-v0.3.4-red)](https://github.com/Diraw/AI-Screenshot-Translator/releases/tag/v0.3.4-test)

# Introduction

This tool allows you to **easily capture screenshots**, send images to AI models for text recognition and translation, and display the translation results in an interactive HTML format in a separate window.

The tool supports **customizable hotkey triggers, multi-window result management, and running in the system tray**, greatly improving translation efficiency in daily work and study.

**Tool Features:** 1. Screenshot translation, hotkey activation; 2. Patch screenshot and translation, freely draggable and resizable, multiple translation patches can be created; 3. Switch original text for formulas for easy copying; 4. Customizable API interface.

**Pain Points Addressed:** 1. Current mainstream whole-document translation tools are bloated; 2. Copying and pasting PDF text for translation sometimes results in messy or uncopyable formula blocks; 3. For image-scanned PDFs, text cannot be copied.
