# Large Model Application Development Learning Path (Quick Pass Version)

This repository contains some materials I organized and studied while learning üî•large model application developmentüî•. All are dry goods, no extra expansions, üí∞making money is the top priorityüí∞. Welcome to read, if it is useful to you, please give a üåü star, thank you!

# ‚úÖ Guide

This project is a simple demo demonstration of large model application development RAG and Agent, all using the LangChain framework, including the most basic literacy courses, mainly to help everyone üßêget started quicklyüßê.  
The directory structure consists of three parts:  
- **LangChain_RAG folder**: RAG-related project demos and study materials;  
- **LangChain_Agent folder**: Agent-related demos and study materials;  
- **Interview**: Interview essentials for large model RAG and Agent.

# ‚úÖ LangChain_RAG

This section has **four parts** in total:  
- llms-1 and llms-2 are üï∂Ô∏è**literacy courses**üï∂Ô∏è on Bilibili, explained clearly and concisely by two streamers, mainly for introductory understanding, just go through quickly;  
- llms-3 is the official LangChain RAG tutorial, here shows the original and the domestic translated version of the video, mainly explaining the main process and optimization points in RAG, **üî•recommend focusing on this, many optimization points are asked in interviewsüî•**;  
- llms-4 is the **üí°RAG projectüí°** example officially given by LangChain, which includes the most basic RAG project process, ensuring you can run it immediately, and the code structure is very simple.

# ‚úÖ LangChain_Agent

This section consists of **two parts**, which are two simple Agent demos from Bilibili, quite easy to understand.
- AI_Agent based on OPENAI_API
- QW_Agent based on QWen_API


## AI_Agent
### Video link:
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JV411F7Yj/
### Code:
- üåπCode repository (‚úÖmy modified code, can run directly‚úÖ): https://github.com/lichuachua/llms-project/tree/main/LangChain_Agents/AI_Agent/
- Original code repository: https://github.com/parallel75/AI_Agent  
- Running platform: local

## QW_Agent
### Video link:
- https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1QF4m177Rx/
### Notes:
- This project requires applying for [Qianwen related keys and API] to run, has some pitfalls, recommended to download my modified code which can run directly, Qianwen updated version requires code update, I have already modified it.
### Code:
