# Netflix Household No More ðŸš«

A browser extension aiming to bypass the Netflix household verification prompts by employing different strategies depending on the page context.

**Supports:** `Chrome` (and Chromium-based browsers like Edge) | `Firefox`

---

## Features

*   **Blocks Verification Request on `/watch`:** Prevents the specific GraphQL network request associated with the household check from running when you are on a video watching page (`/watch/`).
*   **Hides Verification Modal on `/browse` (and others):** On pages *other* than `/watch/` (like the main browse page), it hides the household verification modal popup if it appears.
*   **Target:** Only affects `netflix.com` domains.

## Caveats & Known Issues

*   **Netflix Video player UI is not visible:** If u dont see the video player UI, just refresh the page. that should fix it for you.

*   **Netflix Updates:** Netflix frequently updates its website and internal APIs. Any changes to the GraphQL endpoint URL, the request structure, the page structure (`/watch/` path), or the modal's CSS selectors/HTML structure could break this extension partially or completely.
*   **Console Errors:** When on a `/watch/` page, you **will** see network errors (often CORS-related) in the browser's developer console. This is an expected side effect of the extension successfully blocking the network request. While visually noisy, it generally does not impact performance.
*   **Fragile css:** The modal hiding relies on specific CSS class names and `data-uia` attributes. These might change without notice.
