Please feel free to use it, experiment, and report bugs, but understand that things can and will change over time._\n\n\n\n## Quick Start\n\nKelp works without any build step.\n\n[The CDN](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kelpui/) is the fastest and simplest way to get started, but you can [download the files from GitHub](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp) if you'd prefer.\n\n```html\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/kelpui@0/css/kelp.css\">\n```\n\nKelp uses semantic versioning. You can grab a major, minor, or patch version from the CDN with the `@1.2.3` syntax. You can find all available versions [under releases](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/tags).\n\n\n\n## Demo\n\nThe included `index.html` file is a kitchen sink demo of Kelp. It includes every feature and component in one giant file.\n\nWhile in beta, Kelp has no compile step. The web component use ES imports, and require a local server to run.\n\nUse your preferred server, or use the included `http-server` by running `npm run dev`.\n\n```bash\nnpm install\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nAs Kelp nears v1, it will use a compile step to make this unnecessary.\n\n\n\n## Tests\n\nKelp uses... \n\n- [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) for tests\n- [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting\n- A continuous integration process on deploys and PRs\n\n```bash\n# Run tests\nnpm run test\n\n# Run linter\nnpm run lint\n```\n\n\n\n## License\n\nFree to use under the [Kelp Commons License](https://github.com/cferdinandi/kelp/blob/main/LICENSE.md).
