Thanks to their no-reflex features.\n\n## Story of this project\n\nCurrently, JetBrains AI Assistant provides a free plan with very limited quotes. I tried out and my quote ran out quickly.\n\nI already bought other LLM API tokens, such like Gemini and Qwen. So I started to think of using them in AI Assistant. Unfortunately, only local models from LM Studio and Ollama are supported. So I started to work on this proxy application that proxy third party LLM API as LM Studio and Ollama API so that I can use them in my JetBrains IDEs.\n\nThis is Just a simple task, so I started to use the official SDKs as clients and write a simple Ktor server that provides endpoints as LM Studio and Ollama. The problem appears when I try to distribute it as a GraalVM native image. The official Java SDKS uses too many dynamic features, making it hard to compile into a native image, even with a tracing agent. So I decided to implement a simple client of streaming chat completion API by myself with Ktor and kotlinx.serialization which are both no-reflex, functional and DSL styled.\n\nAs you can see, this application is distributed as a fat runnable jar and a GraalVM native image, which makes it cross-platform and fast to start.\n\nThe development of this application gives me confidence in Kotlin/Ktor/kotlinx.serialization. The Kotlin world uses more functional programming and less reflexion, which makes it more suitable for GraalVM native image, with faster startup and less memory usage.\n\n## Currently supported\n\nProxy from: OpenAI, Claude, DashScope(Alibaba Qwen), Gemini, Deepseek, Mistral, SiliconFlow.\n\nProxy as: LM Studio, Ollama.\n\nStreaming chat completion API only.\n",
