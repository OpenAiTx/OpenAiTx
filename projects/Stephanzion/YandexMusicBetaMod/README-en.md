> [!WARNING]
> UPD 07/09/2025 - Yandex broke modding of Yandex Music, currently only the [spring build](https://github.com/Stephanzion/YandexMusicBetaMod/raw/refs/heads/master/Portable/YandexMusic.7z) works temporarily. You must download exactly this version.


## ❤️ Advantages:
✔️ Works without Plus

💜 Integration with Discord (beta)

👁️ Analytics and tracking disabled

⚙️ Auto-updates disabled

⬇️ Ability to download tracks in mp3

📃 Ability to change fonts to monospaced

</> Ability to enable developer mode


## 💀 Limitations:
• Yandex has strict regional restrictions - the app only works in [certain countries](https://yandex.ru/support/music/ru/access.html). If you use a VPN, change your geolocation to one of them

• The program is not fully portable; the session is stored in the %appdata% folder

• The patcher is in early development. Bugs may occur when updating to a new version of Yandex Music

# 💻 How to install and use:

1. [Download the latest version](https://github.com/Stephanzion/YandexMusicBetaMod/releases/latest) as an installer or build the app yourself from source
2. After installation, **run YandexMusicPatcher as administrator** and select the desired settings
3. Click the "Install mod" button
4. A folder with Yandex Music will appear in the patcher folder, and a shortcut for launch will be on the desktop
5. After launching, the app will automatically take you to the login page

If you want to update to a new version of Yandex Music, just rerun the patcher and click the "Update mod" button


## 🛠 Issues and development help

If the patcher does not work for you, you can [download a ready-made Yandex Music build](https://github.com/Stephanzion/YandexMusicBetaMod/raw/refs/heads/master/Portable/YandexMusic.7z) with standard mods, including bypassing Plus. This build is rarely updated, so using the patcher is recommended.

If something is not working, please [create an issue](https://github.com/Stephanzion/YandexMusicBetaMod/issues/new) and describe the error and the steps to reproduce it in detail. I try to respond and fix issues promptly.

If you have ideas for features or have written your own mod that can be added to the patcher - [write there as well](https://github.com/Stephanzion/YandexMusicBetaMod/issues/new).
